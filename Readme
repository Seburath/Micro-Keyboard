C64 USB Keyboard mod
Original by Pyofer

New for 2019.
Optimized some code, added a second joystick fire button on pin 9, and decided to just go foward with the joystick version.
If you don't want to use joystick support, just use the keyboard connections only. Nothing else needed to config.

Modified to Support restore key,US/EU keymaps and joysticks by dabone.
Wiring is as follows
64 Keyboard connector has 20 Pins with a key Pin @ Pin 2.
Arduino Pro Micro Pinout
