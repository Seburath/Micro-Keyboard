C64 USB Keyboard mod
Original by Pyofer
See original thread @
http://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=55650

New for 2019.
Optimized some code (Well my friend Worm did. :) Thank you so much )
Added a second joystick fire button on pin 9, and decided to just go foward with the joystick version.
If you don't want to use joystick support, just use the keyboard connections only. Nothing else needed to config.

See inside the INO file for wiring instructions.

Variables to take note of.


int DefaultKBMode=0;                                  // Select 0 For Windows Mode On startup or 1 for C64 Mode

If you use 64 mode, the shift key won't be sent to the computer, but the shifted character will be.
64 Mode keysets are the first 2 in each map. 1st is unshifted, 2nd is shifted values.
Windows mode passes the shift key to the computer and lets it handle the key shifting according to the OS keymap

int USKeyboard=1;                                     // Select 1 for US Keyboard or 0 For EU

This selects which keymap, US or EU.
The EU set is a carry over from the original code by Pyofer, and may contain errors, please open a issue if you find one please.

int HybridKeyboard=1;                                 // Select 0 for normal or 1 for the left HybridKey allowing all f keys and cursor keys in windows mode. (Also has a shifted restore key)

Hybridkeys are there to let you actually type Cursor up, Cursor left and F2 F4 F6 F8 to the computer in windows mode.
Without this you could only pass the actual key shifted.


int HybridKey=17;                                     // Position of the Hybrid Select key in the keymap, Left Shift = 17, Right Shift = 64

Selects which shift key to activate hybridkeys. You could also make it a completely different key, this value is the position of the key
in the keyset.
