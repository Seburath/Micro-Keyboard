Found out that the Teensy only works at 24Mhz, 48Mhz causes weird multiple key presses.

Teensy LC Support! Hopefully this will be a much more compatible keyboard implementation.
Currently the LC is available for $12 USD + shipping.
The new versions are located in the C64Key3* directories. 
Both versions are the same program, I just commented out the correct lines for each board.
I've changed a lot again, dropping support for the 64 mode keymaps, and the eu keymap. 
I went with a single keymap that follows the Teensy keyboard macro style.
I'm starting the Teensy at pin 1 instead of zero because I have my original pro micro mounted in a 24 pin socket
and didn't want to rewire. (Also makes testing both versions much easier.)


New for 2019.
Optimized some code (Well my friend Worm did. :) Thank you so much )
Added a second joystick fire button on pin 9, and decided to just go foward with the joystick version.
If you don't want to use joystick support, just use the keyboard connections only. Nothing else needed to config.

01/27/19                  Swapped F10 and F12, Restore key is now F10 unshifted and F12 with left shifted.
                          Added new config files for Vice 3. Tested with Version 3.2 See the readme file in
                          the config directory for where to put the files.
                          Vice 2 hasn't been tested in a while. If there are problems, please let me know.
						  
						  
01/29/19                  Added a second hybrid key, using the ctrl key on the commodore keyboard.
                          F1 is F11, F3 is F12, F5 is Page Up, F7 is Page Down, Restore is F9
						  
						  
						  
See inside the INO file for wiring instructions.

Variables to take note of.

int HybridKeyboard=1;                                 // Select 0 for normal or 1 for the left HybridKey allowing all f keys and cursor keys in windows mode. (Also has a shifted restore key)

Hybridkeys are there to let you actually type Cursor up, Cursor left, F2, F4, F6, F8, F9, F11, F12, PGUP, PGDOWN, and ` to the computer in windows mode.
Without this you could only pass the actual key shifted.

int HybridKey=17;                                     // Position of the Hybrid Select key in the keymap, Left Shift = 17, Right Shift = 64
int HybridKey2=72;                                    // Position of the Hybrid2 Select key in the keymap, CTRL = 72

Selects which shift key to activate hybridkeys. You could also make it a completely different key, this value is the position of the key
in the keyset. 

This allows you to have to directly send the hybrid key values that are contained in the Hybridkeys Array.

KEY_LEFT, KEY_F8, KEY_F2, KEY_F4, KEY_F6, KEY_UP, KEY_F12, 

These are mapped to the following keys

Cursor L/R, F7, F1, F3, F5, Cursor U/D, and Restore. 


The default for Hybridkey is the left shift key, so holding left shift and one of the above keys allows the secondary function of the key,

Right shift will give the original key. So say you needed shift F2, then you would hold both shift keys and press the f1 key.
For a shifted f1, you would only hold the right function key.

Hybridkey2 array has the following values.

KEY_PAGE_DOWN, KEY_F11, KEY_TILDE, KEY_PAGE_UP, KEY_F9,

These are mapped to the following keys

F7, F1, F3, F5, Restore

The default for Hybridkey2 is the CTRL key, so holding CTRL and one of the above keys allows the secondary function of the key,
