02/20/19	Teensy LC Support! Hopefully this will be a much more compatible keyboard implementation
			The new versions are located in the C64Key3* directories. Both versions are the same program, I've just pre commented out the correct stuff for each board.
			I've changed a lot again, dropping support for the 64 mode keymaps, and the eu keymap. I went with a single keymap that follows the Teensy keyboard macro style.
			I'm starting the Teensy at pin 1 instead of zero because I have my original pro micro mounted in a 24 pin socket and didn't want to rewire.
			(Also makes testing both version much easier.)


New for 2019.
Optimized some code (Well my friend Worm did. :) Thank you so much )
Added a second joystick fire button on pin 9, and decided to just go foward with the joystick version.
If you don't want to use joystick support, just use the keyboard connections only. Nothing else needed to config.

01/27/19                  Swapped F10 and F12, Restore key is now F10 unshifted and F12 with left shifted.
                          Added new config files for Vice 3. Tested with Version 3.2 See the readme file in
                          the config directory for where to put the files.
                          Vice 2 hasn't been tested in a while. If there are problems, please let me know.
						  
						  
01/29/19                  Added a second hybrid key, using the ctrl key on the commodore keyboard.
                          F1 is F11, F3 is F12, F5 is Page Up, F7 is Page Down, Restore is F9
						  
						  
						  
See inside the INO file for wiring instructions.

Variables to take note of.

There are more comments in the actual sketch, so be sure to read around.


int DefaultKBMode=0;                                  // Select 0 For Windows Mode On startup or 1 for C64 Mode

If you use 64 mode, the shift key won't be sent to the computer, but the shifted character will be.
64 Mode keysets are the first 2 in each map. 1st is unshifted, 2nd is shifted values.
Windows mode passes the shift key to the computer and lets it handle the key shifting according to the OS keymap

int USKeyboard=1;                                     // Select 1 for US Keyboard or 0 For EU

This selects which keymap, US or EU.
The EU set is a carry over from the original code by Pyofer, and may contain errors, please open a issue if you find one please.

int HybridKeyboard=1;                                 // Select 0 for normal or 1 for the left HybridKey allowing all f keys and cursor keys in windows mode. (Also has a shifted restore key)

Hybridkeys are there to let you actually type Cursor up, Cursor left and F2 F4 F6 F8 to the computer in windows mode.
Without this you could only pass the actual key shifted.

int HybridKey=17;                                     // Position of the Hybrid Select key in the keymap, Left Shift = 17, Right Shift = 64
int HybridKey2=72;                                    // Position of the Hybrid2 Select key in the keymap, CTRL = 72

Selects which shift key to activate hybridkeys. You could also make it a completely different key, this value is the position of the key
in the keyset.
